How it works
Checkpoints run as a Git-aware CLI. On every commit generated by an agent, it writes a structured checkpoint object and associates it with the commit SHA. The code stays exactly the same, we just add context as first-class metadata. When you push your commit, Checkpoints also pushes this metadata to a separate branch (entire/checkpoints/v1), giving you a complete, append-only audit log inside your repository. As a result, every change can now be traced back not only to a diff, but to the reasoning that produced it.

Checkpoints are useful immediately:

Traceability - inspect the reasoning behind any agent-generated change
Faster Reviews - review intent and constraints, not just diffs
Better handoffs - resume work without replaying prompts or sessions
Less token waste - agents stop repeating mistakes that you corrected in past sessions
Multi-session and agent support - support for concurrent agentic sessions
Getting Started
The best part is that you can set up Entire in two easy steps.


curl
curl -fsSL https://entire.io/install.sh | bash

Then navigate to your repository and run entire enable — follow the prompts to configure Entire for that project. That's it. Your agent sessions are captured automatically - in a structured and ready-to-use format.
