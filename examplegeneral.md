Meeting Purpose
To strategize a sales campaign targeting all pending proposals with a discount.
Key Takeaways
Sales Campaign: Launching a campaign to revive ~445 pending proposals with a 4–12% discount (defaulting to 7%) and a Dec 20 expiration. The goal is to meet a $10k decking purchase quota by year-end.
AI-Assisted Vetting: Mauricio will build an AI tool to help Jordan vet proposals for profitability before sending. This addresses Jordan's concern about offering discounts on already-tight jobs (e.g., the McNeil project's $9.9k cedar roof material cost).
Permit Automation: Replacing the current permit runner with an AI-driven system. This solves a communication issue with the current runner and automates the highly redundant permit application process.
Job Costing: Improving job costing by having Angelica (virtual assistant) upload material invoices from the SBS portal directly into JobTread, providing accurate material cost data for every job.
Topics
Client & Team Issues
Demo Material Error: A client's demo material was hauled to the landfill by mistake. The team will provide $1,000–$1,100 in new material to resolve the issue.
Permit Runner Conflict: The permit runner felt "taken advantage of" over bonus expectations, despite earning ~$160/hr. This prompted the decision to replace the role with an AI-driven system.
Doug's Project: The McNeil project's cedar-framed roof has a $9,900 material cost, creating a tight margin. This highlights the risk of offering discounts on jobs with non-standard components, reinforcing the need for careful vetting.
Sales Campaign Strategy
Objective: Drive sales before year-end to meet a $10k decking purchase quota.
Target Audience: ~445 clients with pending proposals.
Offer: 4–12% discount, expiring Dec 20.
Rationale: The range allows for flexibility based on project profitability, with a 7% default.
Process:
Vetting: Jordan must review each proposal before it's sent to ensure profitability.
Communication: Andrew and Jackie will contact clients, framing the offer as a special, hand-picked opportunity.
JobTread Cleanup: Andrew will first clear his "Waiting on Andrew" list, then decline older proposals for clients with multiple pending jobs.
AI & Automation for Efficiency
Proposal Vetting AI:
Goal: Automate Jordan's manual review process to ensure profitability.
Method: Mauricio will export proposal data to a Google Sheet. Jordan will then train an AI model (likely Gemini) by labeling jobs as "profitable" or "unprofitable" and explaining why.
Outcome: The AI will learn Jordan's criteria, enabling faster, more confident vetting.
Permit Automation:
Goal: Automate the highly redundant permit application process.
Method: Use browser automation to auto-fill forms from a data source.
Action: Jackie will test the e-plan submission process to validate the approach.
Job Costing Improvement:
Goal: Get accurate material costs into JobTread for better job costing.
Method: Angelica (virtual assistant) will access the SBS portal to upload material invoices directly into each job's budget.
