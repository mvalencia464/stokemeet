We are also shipping our first product as open source CLI to tie agent context into Git on every push.\nL8: Yet today, we still rely on a software development lifecycle built before the era of the cloud, inherently designed for human-to-human collaboration. And the cracks are forming. Issues were designed for human planning and tracking, not as structured, machine-readable units of work. Git repositories were never extended to version everything developers build with in the AI era. Pull requests simply do not scale for large monorepos. Every day, agents are being choked and throttled by centralized API capacity and rate limits. The truth is: the entire software ecosystem is being bottlenecked by a manual system of production that was never designed for the era of AI in the first place. A system that cannot be retrofitted for what's ahead.\nL10: Just like when automotive companies replaced the traditional craft-based production system with the moving assembly line, we must now reimagine the entire software development lifecycle for a world where machines are the primary producers of code. Creating the assembly line for the era of agents.\nL12: Announcing Entire: The world's next developer platform\nL13: This is the purpose of our new company Entire, to build the world's next developer platform where agents and humans can collaborate, learn, and ship together. A platform that will be open, scalable, and independent for every developer, no matter which agent or model you use.\nL15: Entire will be based on three key components: a git-compatible database that unifies code, intent, constraints, and reasoning in a single version-controlled system; a universal semantic reasoning layer that enables multi-agent coordination through the context graph; and an AI-native software development lifecycle to reinvent the software development lifecycle for agent-to-human collaboration.\nL17: In pursuit of this vision, we are proud to be backed by a $60 million seed investment led by Felicis, with support from Madrona, M12, Basis Set, 20VC, Cherry Ventures, Picus Capital, and Global Founders Capital. Entire is further backed by a slate of international investors including Gergely Orosz, Theo Browne, Jerry Yang, Olivier Pomel, Garry Tan, and others—who all understand that software development is ready for its next platform shift.\nL19: Entire funding announcement\nL21: Our first release: The Entire CLI to track agent context\nL29: Our plan is to support Checkpoints for every agent. Today, Entire CLI ships with support for Anthropic's Claude Code and Google Gemini CLI. Codex, Cursor CLI, and other agents coming soon.\nL32: Checkpoints run as a Git-aware CLI. On every commit generated by an agent, it writes a structured checkpoint object and associates it with the commit SHA. The code stays exactly the same, we just add context as first-class metadata. When you push your commit, Checkpoints also pushes this metadata to a separate branch (entire/checkpoints/v1), giving you a complete, append-only audit log inside your repository. As a result, every change can now be traced back not only to a diff, but to the reasoning that produced it.\nL42: The best part is that you can set up Entire in two easy steps.\nL46: curl -fsSL https://entire.io/install.sh | bash\nL48: Then navigate to your repository and run entire enable — follow the prompts to configure Entire for that project. That's it. Your agent sessions are captured automatically - in a structured and ready-to-use format.\nL53: Most importantly, we're releasing the Entire CLI open source project because we believe that this layer should be portable, independent, and available for every single agent or model. And because we know, we are better with the contributions of the interconnected community of open-source developers.\n---"

As a result, every change can now be traced back not only to a diff, but to the reasoning that produced it.\n\nCheckpoints are useful immediately:\n\nTraceability - inspect the reasoning behind any agent-generated change\nFaster Reviews - review intent and constraints, not just diffs\nBetter handoffs - resume work without replaying prompts or sessions\nLess token waste - agents stop repeating mistakes that you corrected in past sessions\nMulti-session and agent support - support for concurrent agentic sessions\nGetting Started\nThe best part is that you can set up Entire in two easy steps.\n\n\ncurl\ncurl -fsSL https://entire.io/install.sh | bash\n\nThen navigate to your repository and run entire enable — follow the prompts to configure Entire for that project.

I'll explicitly check the `entire` status and logs to verify session activity and any new checkpoints. It seems like the hook failed because my `git commit` didn't add the necessary trailer. I'm going to try adding it manually, and I'll verify the trailer format. I also want to run `entire enable` again to ensure the hooks are enabled.",
